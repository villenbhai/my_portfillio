      <p>Hey there! I’m <strong>Rahul Yadav</strong>, a passionate tech and cybersecurity enthusiast, coder, and digital explorer based in Delhi. I love diving deep into programming, hacking ethically, and building creative solutions that empower and secure the digital world.</p>

      <p>My journey started with a curiosity for computers and coding during my early days at Delhi University. Over time, I honed my skills in Python, C++, Java, and web technologies, blending them with cybersecurity tactics and ethical hacking to create powerful digital defenses.</p>

      <p>When I’m not coding or securing networks, you’ll find me gaming hard in PUBG, Free Fire, or GTA 5, always ready to level up both virtually and in real life. I also mentor aspiring hackers and developers, sharing knowledge and fostering a community of learners and innovators.</p>

      <p><strong>Specialties:</strong> Cybersecurity, Ethical Hacking, Programming (Python, C++, Java), Web Development (Django, React), Bug Bounty Hunting, Gaming Strategies, and Tech Content Creation.</p>

      <p>Outside the digital world, I enjoy writing romantic shayari, reflecting on life’s nuances, and crafting meaningful connections through words. Also, there’s a special someone in my heart — her name is <strong>Rani</strong>, and she inspires me every day.</p>
